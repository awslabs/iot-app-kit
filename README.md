**NEW in 4.0**: IoT Application Kit has been fully migrated to React 18! There are a number of key breaking changes in React 18 that you should be aware of before upgrading to this version, which you can find details about here:

- https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide.html

At this point, AppKit version ^3 versions move into maintenance mode, and will only receive critical upgrades. Please submit a Github issue if you need a new feature and are currently unable to upgrade, and we
will work with you on coming up with a solution.

There should be no breaking changes in the AppKit components themselves, but their behaviors might be altered as a result of this upgrade, so if you find any issues please report them via the github issues at the top, and we will do our best to prioritize these.

Thanks!

IoT Application Kit is a development library for building Industrial IoT web based applications.

IoT App Kit is an open-source library consisting of front-end components and utilities. With IoT App Kit, you can build front-end applications and webpages to utilize IoT data. By default, IoT App Kit helps to retrieve data from [AWS IoT SiteWise](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/what-is-sitewise.html) and [AWS IoT TwinMaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-twinmaker/latest/guide/what-is-twinmaker.html) You can also install plugins to retrieve data from your own sources. Thereâ€™s no charge for using IoT App Kit.

For an example of a real world use case using the IoT App Kit, [visit this tutorial on how to use IoT App Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/build-iot-applications-using-aws-iot-application-kit/)
