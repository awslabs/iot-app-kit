## Overview

IoT Application Kit is a development library for building Industrial IoT web based applications.

IoT App Kit is an open-source library consisting of front-end components and utilities. With IoT App Kit, you can build front-end applications and webpages to utilize IoT data. By default, IoT App Kit helps to retrieve data from [AWS IoT SiteWise](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/what-is-sitewise.html) and [AWS IoT TwinMaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-twinmaker/latest/guide/what-is-twinmaker.html) You can also install plugins to retrieve data from your own sources. There’s no charge for using IoT App Kit.

For an example of a real world use case using the IoT App Kit, [visit this tutorial on how to use IoT App Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/build-iot-applications-using-aws-iot-application-kit/)
