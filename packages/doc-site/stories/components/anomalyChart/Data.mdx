# Anomaly Chart Data Structure

[Learn more about the Anomaly Chart](/docs/components-anomalychart--docs).

The Anomaly provides a timeline view of anomaly predictions, visualizing the raw data in a specific format.

The data structure for the Anomaly chart is an array with a single object, which contains the following properties:

---

**state (string)** : Represents the state of the data, which can be one of the following values:

  * 'loading': Indicates that the data is currently being loaded.
  * 'success': Indicates that the data was loaded successfully.
  * 'failed': Indicates that the data loading failed.
  * 'error': Indicates an error occurred during data loading.

---

**value (object)** : An object containing the raw data and optional style overrides. It has the following properties:

  - **data** (array): An array of objects, where each object represents a single Diagnostic event with a timestamp and Diagnostic object.

      - **timestamp** (number): The time of the diagnostic point, in milliseconds.

      - **diagnostics** (array): An array of objects representing individual data points, where each object has the following properties:
        
        - **name** (string): The name of the diagnostic point.

        - **value** (number): The value of the diagnostic point, which should be a number between 0 and 1.

  - **styles** (object, optional): An object that overrides global style settings. It can have the following properties:

    - **decimalPlaces** (number, optional): Defines the number of decimal places to display for the diagnostic values.

    - **color** (array, optional): An array representing the color palette used to render the diagnostics.


### Example 

Here's an example of the Anomaly chart data structure:

```
{
  state: 'success',
  value: {
    styles: {
      // defines the color pallette for the diagnostics
      color: ['pink', 'blue', 'green', 'red'],
    },
    data: [
      {
        timestamp: 1711078622000,
        diagnostics: [
          {
            name: 'Diagnostic Name 1',
            value: 0.25,
          },
          {
            name: 'Diagnostic Name 2',
            value: 0.25,
          },
          {
            name: 'Diagnostic Name 3',
            value: 0.5,
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        timestamp: 1711165022000,
        diagnostics: [
          {
            name: 'Diagnostic Name 1',
            value: 0.25,
          },
          {
            name: 'Diagnostic Name 2',
            value: 0.25,
          },
          {
            name: 'Diagnostic Name 3',
            value: 0.5,
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

In this example, the state is 'success', indicating that the data was loaded successfully. The value object contains two diagnostic events, each with a timestamp and an array of diagnostic objects. Each diagnostic object has a name and a value between 0 and 1. The styles object overrides the global color palette for rendering the diagnostics, specifying an array of colors (['pink', 'blue', 'green', 'red']).

---

**value (object, required)** : An object containing the raw data and optional style overrides. It has the following properties:

  - **data** (object, required): An object that represents the data in a columnar table by using fields, where each field represents a column in a table, the values in a field represent a the rows in the table, and a single value represents a cell in the table row for that field. The fields together represent a single Diagnostic event with a timestamp and Diagnostic values.

    - **name** (string, optional): The name of the data frame.

    - **fields** (array, required): An array of objects where each object describes one column in the table with the following properties:

      - **name** (string, required): The name of the column, which should be either `time, prediction_reason, prediction, quality, anomaly_score, or <diagnostic name>`.

      - **type** (string, required): The data type of the column, which should be either `time, number, or string`.

      - **values** (array, required): An array of table values whose types are the same as the type property.

    - **length** (number, required): The number of rows in the columnar table.

  - **styles** (object, optional): An object that overrides global style settings. It can have the following properties:

    - **decimalPlaces** (number, optional): Defines the number of decimal places to display for the diagnostic values.

    - **color** (array, optional): An array representing the color palette used to render the diagnostics.


### Example 

Here's an example of the Anomaly chart data structure:

```
{
  state: 'success',
  value: {
    styles: {
      // defines the color pallette for the diagnostics
      color: ['pink', 'blue', 'green', 'red'],
    },
    data: {
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'time',
          type: FieldType.time,
          values: [1714676404000, 1714676405000, 1714676407000, 1714676408000],
        },
        {
          name: 'prediction_reason',
          type: FieldType.string,
          values: [
            'ANOMALY_DETECTED',
            'ANOMALY_DETECTED',
            'ANOMALY_DETECTED',
            'ANOMALY_DETECTED',
          ],
        },
        {
          name: 'Diagnostic 1',
          type: FieldType.number,
          values: [0.27978, 0.2796, 0.27943, 0.27925],
        },
        {
          name: 'Diagnostic 2',
          type: FieldType.number,
          values: [0.10742, 0.10739, 0.10735, 0.10731],
        },
        {
          name: 'Diagnostic 3',
          type: FieldType.number,
          values: [0.21679, 0.21717, 0.21754, 0.21792],
        },
      ],
      length: 4,
      name: 'Diagnostic Data Frame',
    }
  },
};
```

In this example, the state is 'success', indicating that the data was loaded successfully. The value object contains four diagnostic events, represented by index across the values of each field. Each diagnostic field object has a name and values between 0 and 1. The styles object overrides the global color palette for rendering the diagnostics, specifying an array of colors (['pink', 'blue', 'green', 'red']).
