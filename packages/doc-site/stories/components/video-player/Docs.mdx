# VideoPlayer

The VideoPlayer component allows streaming a video from the Kinesis Video Streams. It supports the following configuration:

- Simple mode: Stream the video from the Kinesis Video Streams using the provided stream name.
- AWS IoT TwinMaker mode: Video player is provided with the `entityId` and `componentName` from an AWS IoT TwinMaker workspace. 
  Video player determines the required information using provided inputs and streams the video. Details are at 
  [AWS IoT TwinMaker video integration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-twinmaker/latest/guide/video-integration.html).

## Basic React component usage

Sample code in [examples/react-app](https://github.com/awslabs/iot-app-kit/tree/main/examples/react-app) shows how to use this component in detail.

```tsx
import { initialize } from '@iot-app-kit/source-iottwinmaker';
import { VideoPlayer } from '@iot-app-kit/react-components';

const videoData = initialize({ ... }).videoData({
    entityId: 'twinmakerEntityId',
    componentName: 'twinmakerComponentName',
    kvsStreamName: 'sample-kvs-stream',
});

// Video player for On-Demand playback mode with specified start and end time
<VideoPlayer
  videoData={videoData}
  viewport={{ start: startTime, end: endTime }}
/>

// Video player for Live playback mode
<VideoPlayer
  videoData={videoData}
  viewport={{ duration: '0' }}
/>
```

## VideoPlayer Properties

The VideoPlayer component has the following customizable properties:

#### videoData (Videodata object):

The class to fetch the video metadata and handle the video source related operations. The object `VideoData` is defined in `@iot-app-kit/source-iottwinmaker`.

**Note**: Pass in a new instance of this object 
for the VideoPlayer to trigger a new loading of the video stream. Do not recreate this object unless absolutely necessary.

#### viewport (Viewport object):

Specifies the time range for video playback. The object `Viewport` is defined in `@iot-app-kit/core`.

**Example**

```tsx
// On-Demand mode with specific start and end times
const startTime = new Date(1661470165);
const endTime = new Date(1661471180);
const viewport = {{ start: startTime, end: endTime }};

// Live mode to play video from now
const viewport = {{ duration: '0' }};
```

# RequestVideoUpload

Send a request with the RequestVideoUpload component to upload video from edge to the Kinesis Video Streams. This is used 
for an Edge Video component in an AWS IoT TwinMaker workspace, that is available on the edge, but is not available for streaming. 
The newly uploaded video is streamed by the `VideoPlayer` component from Kinesis Video Streams once it's available.
