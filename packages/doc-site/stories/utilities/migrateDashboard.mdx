# migrateDashboard

`migrateDashboard` is a function which allows you to easily migrate your Sitwise Monitor dashboards into applications developed using [Iot Application Kit](https://github.com/awslabs/iot-app-kit).

## Usage

To use `migrateDashboard` provide the `dashboardId` of your Sitewise Montitor dashboard and an object that contains the implementation of a `describeDashboard` API call. It returns
a promise with the dashboard configuration of the now migrated AppKit dashboard which can be passed into the dashboard component.

## Example
```
    import { migrateDashboard } from '@iot-app-kit/dashboard';
    import { IoTSiteWise } from '@aws-sdk/client-iotsitewise';
    import { Dashboard } from '@iot-app-kit/dashboard';

    const client = new IoTSiteWise({
        credentials: awsCredentials,
        region: awsRegion,
    });

    const MyDashboard = () => {
        const options = {
            parameterss: {dashboardId: "sitewiseMonitorDashboardId"}
            iotSitewiseClient: client
        }
        const appKitDashboardConfiguration = await migrateDashboard(options);

        return <Dashboard dashboardConfig={appKitDashboardConfiguration} />;
    };
```
