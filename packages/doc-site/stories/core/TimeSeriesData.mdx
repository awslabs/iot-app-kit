# Time series data APIs

The core package contains functionality and data types that are shared across all IoT App Kit sources. 
The core defines a common time series data structure and functionality, as well as utilities to help 
create a [custom time series data source](https://github.com/awslabs/iot-app-kit/tree/main/docs/CustomSources.md).

You can download the core module from [here](https://npmjs.com/package/@iot-app-kit/core).

### APIs

### TimeSeriesData API

A time series data structure.

**dataStreams (object)**: 
A collection of data streams. A data stream represents a single dataset.
When you define a data stream, you can specify the following information:

**id (string)**: 
The ID of the data stream.

**data (array)**: 
Raw data from the data stream, excluding aggregated values (for example, average, minimum, and maximum).

**Note**: 
If the value of `resolution` is greater than 0, IoT Application Kit retrieves data from the 
`aggregates` property instead of the `data` property.

Specify the following for this property:
  - **x(number)**: The date the data point was measured, in Unix epoch time.
  - **y(Number | String | Boolean)**: The value of the data point. The value type depends on the value of `dataType`. 
  For example, if the value of `dataType` is `NUMBER` , the `y` value is a number. 

#### Example 

#### data

```
[
  [new Date(2000, 1, 1).getTime(), 'OK'],
  [new Date(2012, 1, 1).getTime(), 'CRITICAL']
]
```
**resolution**:
The time interval in milliseconds, during data aggregation. Set `resolution` to 0, to retrieve raw data.

**dataType (string)**:
The data type of the `y` property. The value of `dataType` must be one of the following:

  - **NUMBER** - Value is a number (for example, `12.0`).
  - **STRING** - Value is a string (for example, `"OK"` and `"WARNING"`).
  - **BOOLEAN** - Value is a Boolean value that must be `true` or `false`.

**name (string)**:
A friendly name that helps identify the data stream.

**aggregates (object, optional)**:
A map of `resolution`, in milliseconds, to its associated data points. 
The `resolution` in the `dataStreams` is a key in the `aggregates` object. 
To visualize the data stream, the `resolution` must match one of the `aggregates`.

  - **resolution (object, number)**: This is the key for the object. It denotes the time interval in milliseconds, during data aggregation. 
  To retrieve raw data, set `resolution` to 0.
  - **dataPoint (object)**: The data points measured during the specified resolution.

**detailedName (string, optional)**: A detailed name for the data stream. Use this property to 
specify features, such as detailed tooltip information.

**unit (string, optional)**: The unit of the `y` values retrieved from the associated data stream 
(for example, `"m/s"` and `"count"`).

**color (string, optional)**: A CSS color string, (for example, "#5e87b5" or "red"). 
In the context of IoT App Kit, defaults to a color selected by the widget, if applicable.

**isLoading (boolean, optional)**: Checks if the data stream has never fetched data before, and is currently fetching data. 
The default is `false`.

**isRefreshing (boolean, optional)**: Checks if the data stream is currently fetching data, 
regardless of whether it has fetched data previously. The default is `false`.

**error (string, optional)**: The error associated with the source from which the data stream is retrieved.

**associatedDataStreams (array, optional)**: Data streams associated with alarms. When you configure an associated data stream, 
you can specify the following:

 - **id(string)**: The ID of the associated data stream.
 - **streamType(string)**: The data stream type for the associated data stream. It must be one of the following values:

    - **ALARM** - Alarm data stream type.
    - **ANOMALY** - Anomaly data stream type.
    - **ALARM_THRESHOLD** - Alarm threshold stream type.

**viewport (object)**: Specifies the window over which to visualize data. For example, a scatter chart with the following `viewport` display data from 2000 to 2001. In addition, their `y` value must be greater than or equal to 0, and less than or equal to 100.

#### Example
```
{
  start: new Date(2000, 0, 0),
  end: new Date(2001, 0, 0),
  yMin: 0,
  yMax: 100
}
```

To configure `viewport`, specify the following fields:

 - **start (date, optional)**: The start date of the `viewport` from which to visualize data. 
 Do not specify `start` if `duration` is defined.

 - **end (date, optional)**: The end date in the `viewport` from which to visualize data. 
  Do not specify an `end` if `duration` is defined.

 - **yMin (number, optional)**: The minimum `y` value. The visualization will not display data points 
  when the `y` values are less than `yMin`. This defaults to a value small enough to ensure all data 
  within the viewport falls at or above the  `yMin`. Some components ignore this value.

 - **yMax (number, optional)**: The maximum `y` value. The visualization will not display data points 
  when `y` values are greater than `yMax`. This defaults to a value large enough to ensure all data 
  within the viewport falls at or below the  `yMax`. Some components ignore this value.

 - **duration (number, optional)**: The duration for which to display data, 
 in milliseconds. Use `duration` to specify a live time frame. Don’t specify `duration` to 
 view only historical data.

### TimeSeriesDataSettings

This specifies how IoT Application Kit requests time series data.

**requestBuffer(number)**: The number of additional days to request data beyond the specified `viewport.start` and `viewport.end`. 
For example, if the `requestBuffer` is 0, no additional data is requested. If the `requestBuffer` is 1, IoT Application Kit will 
request data from `viewport.start-1` to `viewport.end+1` . The `requestBuffer` is a linear function. If the buffer doubles, 
the duration to request data roughly doubles.

The request buffer won’t cause a precise amount of additional data to be requested. For example, 
if the `requestBuffer` is 1, it won’t necessarily cause exactly one day of data to be requested 
before and after the viewport. This behavior prevents panning, and other gestures that occur at 
near 60fps from triggering data requests on every frame.

**refreshRate (number, optional)**: Specifies how often to request data again, in milliseconds. 
This applies to data whose time to live (TTL) has expired, or to live streaming data when `viewport.duration` is specified. 
The default value is `5` seconds.

**resolution (optional)**: The time interval in which to aggregate data (for example, average, minimum, and maximum). 
For example, if the resolution is `1d`, IoT Application Kit aggregates your data once every 24 hours (1 day). 
For more information about the supported units and format, see [parse-duration](https://github.com/jkroso/parse-duration) on GitHub.

The valid resolutions for AWS IoT SiteWise are the following:

  * `0` - Raw data (unaggregated data). IoT Application Kit uses the [GetAssetPropertyValueHistory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_GetAssetPropertyValueHistory.html) operation to fetch your data.
  * `1m` - Minute aggregated data. IoT Application Kit uses the [GetAssetPropertyAggregates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_GetAssetPropertyAggregates.html) operation to aggregate your data.
  * `1h` - Hourly aggregated data. IoT Application Kit uses the [GetAssetPropertyAggregates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_GetAssetPropertyAggregates.html) operation to aggregate your data.
  * `1d` - Daily aggregated data. IoT Application Kit uses the [GetAssetPropertyAggregates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_GetAssetPropertyAggregates.html) operation to aggregate your data.


When the resolution is an object, it contains a key that represents a viewport duration. The corresponding value of the key value pair has its resolution applied to.

#### Example resolution configuration:

```
{
  0: '0',
  1h: '1m',
  1d: '1h'
}
```

If the duration of the viewport is less than an hour, the visualization displays raw data. 
If the duration of the viewport is greater than an hour and less than a day, the visualization 
displays data that is aggregated once every minute. If the duration of the viewport is greater than a day, 
the visualization displays data that is aggregated once every 24 hours.

**viewport duration (string, key)**: The size of the viewport that the corresponding resolution applies to. 
All viewport durations at this duration, but with a smaller duration than the next largest duration specified as a key, 
will have the corresponding resolution applied.

**resolution (string|object, value)**: The aggregation level to be applied when the duration of the viewport 
matches the specified viewport duration by the rules specified in the viewport duration key. 
For more information about the supported units and format, see [parse-duration](https://github.com/jkroso/parse-duration) on GitHub.

**fetchFromStartToEnd (boolean, optional)**: If `true`, all data within the viewport is required, and will be requested. 
Additional data outside of the viewport is requested based on the `requestBuffer`. 
The default value is dependent on which IoT App Component is being used.

**fetchMostRecentBeforeStart (boolean, optional)**: If `true`, the data point that is at, or before `viewport.start` is requested. 
For example, in a viewport with a time interval from May 1, to May 2, 2021 and there is no data in that time period,
but there is a single data point on April 1, 2021, the query returns the data point on April 1, 2021. 
The default value is dependent on which IoT App component is being used.

**fetchMostRecentBeforeEnd (boolean, optional)**: If `true`, the data point that is at, or before `viewport.end` will be requested. 
For example, if in a viewport that contains a time interval from May 1, to May 2, 2021, and there is no data in that time period,
but there is a single data point on April 1, 2021, the query returns the data point on April 1st. 
The default value is dependent on which IoT App component is being used.
