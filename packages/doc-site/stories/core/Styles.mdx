# Styles

The `styles` property is present across many IoT App Kit visualizations that utilize `queries` to provided data to the widget.

`Styles` enable the ability to customize certain settings such as the display name, color, etc., from your data streams within your widget.

For example, suppose we had a bar chart, and we want to display "Windmill 2000", you could visualize the wattage output with a line chart as follows:

```
<LineChart
  queries={[
    query.timeSeriesData({
      assets: [{
        assetId: 'windmill-asset-2000',
        properties: [{ propertyId: 'wattage' }]
      }]
    })
 ]}
/>
```

Awesome! Though what if we want to display the wattage output as not the default blue hue, but as orange?

We can go ahead and add two new pieces to our line chart to achieve this:

1. Add a `refId` with a name of our choosing. For this example, we are using 'wattage-styles'
2. Add the `styles` property, which maps the name we picked to the styles we want to associate with

```
<LineChart
  queries={[
    query.timeSeriesData({
      assets: [{
        assetId: 'windmill-asset-2000',
        properties: [{ propertyId: 'wattage', refId: 'wattage-styles' }]
      }]
    })
 ]}

  styles={{ 'wattage-styles': { color: 'orange' } }}
/>
```

This will now give us the wattage output, with the orange coloring as we desired.
