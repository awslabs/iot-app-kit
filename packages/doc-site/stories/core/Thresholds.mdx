# Thresholds
Thresholds enable the ability to configure how data is visualized when the data breaches conditions specified by the threshold.

A threshold contains the following properties:

- **value (object)**:
  The value the threshold compares data streams values against. The type must be one of the following:
  - `String`
  - `Boolean`
  - `Number`

- **color (string)**:
  The color to visualize data that breaches the threshold. Must be a css color string.

- **icon (string)**:
  Display the icon in contexts (such as legends) when a data stream is breached by the threshold.

- **showValue (boolean, optional)**:
  Displays the value of the threshold when visualized on certain widgets, such as line-chart.

- **label (string, optional)**:
  The label associated with threshold.

- **description (string, optional)**:
  The description of the threshold.

- **isEditable (boolean, optional)**:
  Configures whether the threshold is editable within the visualization. This is only supported in line chart, scatter chart and bar chart. Defaults to false.

- **id (string, optional)**:
  The identifier for threshold, used with `isEditable`. 
  This allows the application utilizing the editable thresholds to know 
  which threshold is being altered.

- **comparisonOperator (string)**:
  The operator to use for data comparison. The comparison operator must be one 
  of the following values:

  - `LT`: Less than the threshold value. Only supports numerical data.
  - `GT`: Greater than the threshold value. Only supports numerical data.
  - `LTE`: Lesser than or equal to the threshold value. Only supports numerical data.
  - `GTE`: Greater than or equal to the threshold value. Only supports numerical data.
  - `EQ`: Equal to the threshold value.
  - `CONTAINS`: Contains the threshold value. Only supports strings.

- **severity (number, optional)**:
  The severity of the threshold, used to determine the breached threshold to visualize.

- **dataStreamIds (array, optional)**:
  The data stream ids that the threshold evaluates against. It defaults to 
  undefined, which indicates the threshold applies to all data streams.

## ThresholdSettings
  The settings that configure threshold interpretation. It has the following properties:

- **colorBreachedData (boolean, optional)**:
  This configures if a breached threshold results in the widget data 
  to be colored according to the threshold. It defaults to `true`.

## StyledThreshold
An extension of the threshold type that adds seetings for the threshold styling. It contains
the following properties:

- **visible (boolean, optional)**:
  This determines if a met threshold is visible.

- **visible (string, optional)**:
  This determines if a met threshold applies a filling color,
   or creates a line representing the threshold
