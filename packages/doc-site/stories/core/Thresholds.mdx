# Thresholds
Thresholds enable the ability to configure how data is visualized when the data breaches conditions specified by the threshold.

A threshold contains the following properties

- `value`

  The value the threshold compares data streams values against.

  Type: String, Boolean or Number

- `color`

  The color to visualize data that breaches the threshold. Must be a css color string

  Type: String

- `icon`

  The icon to displaay in certain contexts (such as a legend) when a data stream is breached by the threshold.

  Type: String;

- `showValue`:

  (Optional) Whether to display the value of the threshold when visualized on certain widgets, such as line-chart.

  Type: Boolean

- `label`:

  (Optional) label associated with threshold

  Type: String

- `description`:

  (Optional) description of the threshold

  Type: String

- `isEditable`:

  (Optional) Configures whether the threshold can be edited within the visualization. Only supported in line chart, scatter chart and bar chart. Defaults to false.

  Type: Boolean

- `id`:

  (Optional) identifier for threshold, used in junction with `isEditable` to allow action the application utilizing the editable thresholds to know which threshold is being altered.

  Type: String

- `comparisonOperator`

  The operator to use in which data is compared against.

  Comparison operator must be one of the following values:

  - 'LT': Less than the threshold value. Only supports numerical data
  - 'GT': Greater than the threshold value. Only supports numerical data
  - 'LTE': Lesser than or equal to the threshold value. Only supports numerical data
  - 'GTE': Greater than or equal to the threshold value. Only supports numerical data
  - 'EQ': Equal to the threshold value
  - 'CONTAINS': Contains the threshold value. Only supports strings

  Type: String

- `severity`

  (Optional) Severity of the threshold, utilized to determine which breached threshold to visualize.

  Type: Number


- `dataStreamIds`

  (Optional) The data stream ids that the threshold evaluates against. Defaults to undefined, which means the threshold
  applies to all data streams.

  Type: Array


# ThresholdSettings
Settings that configure how thresholds are interpreted.

Contains the following properties:

- `colorBreachedData`

  (Optional) configures whether a breached threshold results in the data on a widget to be colored according to the threshold. Defaults to true.

  Type: Boolean
