# Viewport

A viewport is an object that specifies an interval of time. Viewports can either specify 
an explicit range of time, or specify a `duration` which signifies the 
viewport is showing data from the time interval between now and `duration` units ago.

A viewport is a common concept across IoT App Kit, and is managed through the [useViewport hook](http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/react-hooks-useviewport--docs) and the [ViewportManager](http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/components-viewportmanager--docs).

## Properties

A viewport contains the following fields:

 - **start (date, optional)**:
    The start of the range from which to visualize data. If `duration` is not specified, 
    you must specify a `start` date.

 - **end (date, optional)**:
    The end of the range from which to visualize data. If `duration`is not specified, 
    you must specify an `end` date.

 - **duration (string, optional)**:
    The time interval in which to visualize data. If a `start` or `end` field is not specified,
    you must specify a `duration` which must be one of the following:

    - `m`: minutes
    - `h`: hours
    - `d`: days
    - `w`: weeks
    
    For example, `2m` represents 2 minutes, 
    `2h` represents 2 hours, `2d` represents 2 days, and `2w` represents 2 weeks. 
    For more information about the supported units and format, see [parse-duration](https://github.com/jkroso/parse-duration) on GitHub.
