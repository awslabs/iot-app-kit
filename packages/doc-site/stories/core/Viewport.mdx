# Viewport

A viewport is an object which specifies an interval of time. Viewports can either specify an explicit range of time,
or specify a duration which signifies that the viewport is always showing data from within the interval of time between now, and `duration` ago.

A viewport is a common concept across IoT App Kit, which can be managed through the [useViewport hook](http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/react-hooks-useviewport--docs) and the [ViewportManager](http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/components-viewportmanager--docs).

## Properties

A viewport contains the following fields:

 - `start`

(Optional) The start of the range from which to visualize data. If no `duration`, you must specify a `start` date.

Type: Date

 - `end`

(Optional) The end of the range from which to visualize data. If no `duration`, you must specify an `end` date.

Type: Date

 - `duration`

(Optional) The time interval over which to visualize data. If no `start` or `end`, you must specify a `duration`. You can use `m`, `h`, `d`, and `w` when you specify a duration. For example, `2m` represents 2 minutes, `2h` represents 2 hours, `2d` represents 2 days, and `2w` represents 2 weeks. For more information about the supported units and format, see [parse-duration](https://github.com/jkroso/parse-duration) on GitHub.
