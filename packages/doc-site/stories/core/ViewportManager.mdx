# Viewport manager utility

The viewport manager is an exposed utility of `@iot-app-kit/core` which allows IoT App Kit components to synchronize their viewport within the
specified viewport group.

See a live demo of this within the (SynchroCharts demo on synchronization)[https://synchrocharts.com/#/Features/Synchronization]. This example
demonstrates 3 line charts within the same viewport group. When a chart is panned, it communicates the updated viewport to the entire group. 
Viewport manager enables this functionality.

### Example

Import the `viewportManager` in your component and subscribe to it.

```
import { viewportManager } from '@iot-app-kit/core';

const { viewport, unsubscribe } = viewportManager.subscribe(viewport.group, (viewport) => {
  // Use the updated viewport
})
```

### Viewport manager methods 

**subscribe(viewportGroup, callback)**:
This method subscribes to viewport updates from the specified viewport group. 
When the viewport group has an update passed to it, the callback is
fired with the updated viewport.

Returns:
  - `viewport`: The current viewport of the group when subscribing. Returns `undefined` if there is no current viewport associated with the group.
  - `unsubscribe() -> void`: Unsubscribe method to the viewport updates. When this method is invoked, the callback is not called when the viewport group is updated.

**update(viewportGroup, viewport) -> void**:
This method provides the updated viewport to the specified viewport group.

**reset() -> void**:
Completely resets all viewport groups, including removal of all subscriptions and removal of all viewports associated with viewport groups.


## Notes

Currently, we don't support switching viewport group through Viewport Manager.
If a component changes its viewport group, it must unsubscribe from the old group and then subscribe to the new viewport.
Otherwise, the component will still continue previous subscription to the old group, and will change along with the old group.
