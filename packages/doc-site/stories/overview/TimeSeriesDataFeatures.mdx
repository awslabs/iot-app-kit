# Time series data

Time series data is an important part of IoT data. IoT App Kit comes with a set of features and tools to help efficiently manage time series data.

## Sharing data 

Multiple widgets may need to display the exact same time series data. Data is shared between widgets. IoT App Kit handles data sharing, behind the scenes.

## Batching
To improve network efficiency, IoT App Kit extends support for a data source to batch requests together. For example, 
the `iot-sitewise` source can batch up to 16 requests into a single network request. This is performance improving, especially 
when trying to display many different widgets with real time data.

## Caching

IoT App Kit manages a cache, that is aware of what sections of data needs to be requested, allowing you to efficiently live stream data. 

### Cache expiration

Most data sources do not have data instantly available. When there is a request for data, there may be missing data points. 
Data can potentially have varying lag within the data ingestion time period. We must
re-request intervals of data previously requested to ensure no data is missed. This is solved by IoT App Kit with the ability to 
support a cache. The TTL of the data requested depends on how old the data is.

For instance, if you request data from a week ago, you likely have all the data present and never need to re-request it. 
If you are requesting the last minute of data, there is a greater chance of needing to re-request data.

IoT App Kit has a fine balance between having the most recent data, and not supporting too many network requests for data.

IoT App Kits `@iot-app-kit/source-iotsitewise` defaults have the following configuration:

- Dateata less than 72 seconds old will be re-requested at the rate specified by the user provided `refreshRate`, which defaults to 5 seconds.
- Data older than 72 seconds but newer than 3 minutes will re-request every 30 seconds.
- Data older than 3 minutes but newer than 20 minutes will re-request every 5 minutes.
- Data older than 20 minutes is never re-requested.

### Combining small request intervals

It is possible for many small intervals of data to be requested, seperated by **thin** bands of cached data. This may cause 
a **fracturing** of requests, leading to more network requests and declining performance, which goes against the goals of the cache.

To solve this, IoT App Kit combines intervals which are equested into a single larger interval, if they are seperated by 1 second or less.
