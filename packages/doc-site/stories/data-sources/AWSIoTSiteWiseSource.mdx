# AWS IoT SiteWise source

The AWS IoT SiteWise source enables you to visualize and interact with your [AWS IoT SiteWise](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/what-is-sitewise.html) data and assets.

Download [AWS IoT SiteWise source](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iot-app-kit/source-iotsitewise) here.

## Setting up the AWS IoT SiteWise source

To set up the AWS IoT SiteWise source, follow the instructions at [Getting started with IoT Application Kit](https://github.com/awslabs/iot-app-kit/tree/main/docs/GettingStarted.md).

---

## Queries

The AWS IoT SiteWise source provides queries used to filter AWS IoT SiteWise data and assets.

Queries are available the AWS IoT SiteWise source is initialized.

### Example

```
import { initialize } from '@iot-app-kit/source-iotsitewise
const iotSiteWiseClient = new IoTSiteWiseClient({ region: "REGION" });

const { query } = initialize({ iotSiteWiseClient });
```

#### Query construction example

```
query.timeSeriesData({
  assets: [{
    assetId: 'id',
    properties: [{ propertyId: 'property', refId: 'my-property' }]
  }]
})
```

This query for time series data, is used by the IoT App Kit components that support time series data.

### APIs

### TimeSeriesData API

A method used to construct the query to process AWS IoT SiteWise time series data. The first parameter is the query, 
and the second parameter is the time series data settings. It controls what data to request from AWS IoT SiteWise.

#### Parameters

**assets (optional)**:

One or more AWS IoT SiteWise assets that contain time series data.
When you ingest data into AWS IoT SiteWise from your industrial equipment, your devices, equipment, and processes 
are each represented as assets. Each asset has data associated with it. 
For example, a piece of equipment might have time series values for availability, performance, quality, 
temperature, and pressure.
To learn more about AWS IoT SiteWise assets, 
see [Modeling industrial assets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/industrial-asset-models.html) 
in the *AWS IoT SiteWise User Guide*. Type: Array

Each asset contains the following fields:

  - **assetId (string)**: The ID of the asset in which the specified property is created.
  - **propertyAlias (string)**: The alias for the property. For example, `/company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature`.
  - **properties (array)**: One or more asset properties. Asset properties are structures within each asset,
   that contain industrial data. Each property has a data type and may contain an unit. 
   To learn more about asset properties, see [Defining data properties](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/asset-properties.html) in the *AWS IoT SiteWise User Guide*. 
   Each property contains the following fields:

      - **propertyId (string)**: The ID of the SiteWise asset property.
      - **resolution (string, optional)**: The time interval of data aggregation. (For example, average, minimum, and maximum). 
      If the resolution is `1d`, IoT Application Kit aggregates your data once every 24 hours (1 day). 
      For more information about the supported units and format, see [parse-duration](https://github.com/jkroso/parse-duration) on GitHub.
      If left blank, the default behavior is to display data in a more aggregated form, when the time period of data shown is increased. See 
      below:

        * When a `viewport` with less than 15 minutes of data is being displayed, request raw data.
        * When a `viewport` with less than 15 hours of data is being displayed, request minute aggregated data.
        * When a `viewport` with less than 60 days of data is being displayed, request hourly aggregated data.
        * When a `viewport` with more than 60 days of data is being displayed, request daily aggregated data.

        Valid resolutions for AWS IoT SiteWise are:

        * `0` - Raw data (unaggregated data). IoT Application Kit uses the [GetAssetPropertyValueHistory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_GetAssetPropertyValueHistory.html) operation to fetch your data.
        * `1m` - Minute aggregated data. IoT Application Kit uses the [GetAssetPropertyAggregates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_GetAssetPropertyAggregates.html) operation to aggregate your data.
        * `1h` - Hourly aggregated data. IoT Application Kit uses the [GetAssetPropertyAggregates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_GetAssetPropertyAggregates.html) operation to aggregate your data.
        * `1d` - Daily aggregated data. IoT Application Kit uses the [GetAssetPropertyAggregates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_GetAssetPropertyAggregates.html) operation to aggregate your data.

  - **cacheSettings (object, optional)**: The cache settings to customize for the given asset property. It contains the following:
    - **refId (string, optional)**: The reference ID of the style settings. IoT App Kit applies the style settings to the asset property associated with the reference ID. Every component has different style settings.
    - **properties (optional)**: One or more AWS IoT SiteWise properties, referenced by the property alias.

  - **requestSettings (object, optional)**: Specifies how often an user requests time-series data in live mode in milliseconds during a refresh.
    Contains the following properties:
    - **refreshRate (number, optional)**: The default value of the refreshRate field is 5000 milliseconds. 
    The minimum value is 1000 milliseconds. Passing in a number below 1000 milliseconds into refreshRate will default to 1000 milliseconds.

This query will request data every 5 seconds in live mode. 

#### Example
```
query.timeSeriesData({
  assets: [{
    assetId: 'id',
    properties: [{ propertyId: 'alarmStatePropertyId' }]
    requestSettings: {
      refreshRate: 5000
    }
  }]
})
```

### TimeSeriesDataSettings API

Specifies how IoT Application Kit requests time series data. To learn more about how to configure TimeSeriesDataSettings, 
see TimeSeriesDataSettings under [Core](https://github.com/awslabs/iot-app-kit/tree/main/docs/Core.md).

#### Example

The following AWS IoT SiteWise query retrieves data from the `temperature` asset property and the `rpm` asset property. 
These two asset properties were created in the `engine-turbine` asset. The query retrieves raw data from the `rpm` asset property.


```
const { IoTSiteWiseClient } = require('@aws-sdk/client-iotsitewise');
import { initialize } from '@iot-app-kit/source-iotsitewise';
const { defineCustomElements } = require('@iot-app-kit/components/loader');

const iotSiteWiseClient = new IoTSiteWiseClient({ region: "REGION" });

defineCustomElements();

// initialize source-iotsitewise
const { query } = initialize({ iotSiteWiseClient });

// jsx
<iot-line-chart
  viewport={{ duration: '10m' }}

  queries={[
    query.timeSeriesData({
      assets: [{
        assetId: 'engine-turbine',
        properties: [
          { propertyId: 'temperature' },
          { propertyId: 'rpm', resolution: '0' }
        ]
      }]
    }, {
      refreshRate: 1000, // In milliseconds
    })
  ]}
/>
```

## TimeSeriesDataSettings Properties

- **assetTree (object)** : The asset tree object provides a collection of methods that query a tree of AWS IoT SiteWise assets. 
This is used in the [resource explorer](https://github.com/awslabs/iot-app-kit/tree/main/docs/ResourceExplorer.md), 
to navigate and select target assets. The asset tree contains the following methods:

  - **fromRoot (function)**: A query that returns a list of root assets in your AWS Account. 

    #### Example 

    ```
    query.assetTree.fromRoot({
        withModels: true,
        withPropertyValues: ['asset-property-1', 'asset-property-2']
    })
    ```


  - **fromAsset (function)**: A query that returns a list of child assets that is associated with the specified root asset.

    #### Example 

    ```
    query.assetTree.fromAsset({
        asset: { assetId: 'asset-1'},
        withModels: true,
        withPropertyValues: ['asset-property-1', 'asset-property-2']
    })
    ```

The function takes the following parameters:

  - **asset (object)**: The AWS IoT SiteWise asset to query.  
    The asset contains the field:

    - **assetId (string)**: The ID of the AWS IoT SiteWise asset to query.
    - **withModels (boolean, optional)**: Decides to fetch or not to fetch asset models that are associated with the specified asset. 
      The default value is `false`.
    - **withPropertyValues (boolean, optional)** : Decides to fetch or not to fetch the current value of the specified asset 
    properties that were created in the specified asset. Property values are not automatically updated. Use the `timeSeriesData` 
    query to update property values. The default value is `false`.


### AnomalyData

A method used to construct the query to process AWS IoT SiteWise anomaly data. The first parameter is the query.

#### Parameters

Controls the data to request from AWS IoT SiteWise.

  - **assetId (string)**: The ID of the asset in which the specified prediction model was created.
  - **predictionDefinitionId (string)**: The ID of the prediction definition.

  #### Example

  ```
  const { IoTSiteWiseClient } = require('@aws-sdk/client-iotsitewise');
  import { initialize } from '@iot-app-kit/source-iotsitewise';
  import { AnomalyChart } from '@iot-app-kit/react-components';

  const iotSiteWiseClient = new IoTSiteWiseClient({ region: "REGION" });

  // initialize source-iotsitewise
  const { query } = initialize({ iotSiteWiseClient });

  // jsx
  <AnomalyChart
    query={
      query.anomalyData({
        assetId: 'engine-turbine',
        predictionDefinitionId: 'engine-turbine-prediction-model',
      })
    }
  />
  ```

### SiteWiseDataSourceSettings

These settings are provided when initializing the AWS IoT SiteWise source. These are optional.

#### Example

```
import { initialize } from '@iot-app-kit/source-iotsitewise';

const { IoTSiteWiseClient } = require("@aws-sdk/client-iotsitewise");

const iotSiteWiseClient = new IoTSiteWiseClient({ region: "REGION" });

const { query } = initialize({ iotSiteWiseClient, settings: { batchDuration: 100 } });
```
## SiteWiseDataSourceSettings Properties

- **batchDuration (number, optional)**: The timeframe in which to coalesce time-series data requests before executing a batch request, 
specified in `ms`. For example, a `batchDuration` of 100 causes the AWS IoT SiteWise source to repeatedly batch all requests 
that occur within a 100 ms timeframe.

The AWS IoT SiteWise source communicates with SiteWise using batch APIs to reduce network overhead. 
By default, all individual requests for time-series data that occur within a single frame of execution 
are coalesced and executed in a batch request. 
This behaviour is scheduled using the [Job and JobQueue](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/#sec-jobs-and-job-queues) concepts. 
Depending on dashboard configuration, widget configuration, latency, and a multitude of other factors, 
batching on a single frame of execution might not be desirable.

## Alarms

AWS IoT SiteWise has [alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/industrial-alarms.html).

The source of alarms in IoT Application Kit is AWS IoT Events. AWS IoT Events alarms are able to process and alarm on AWS IoT SiteWise data.

To query the alarm, you must know the **AlarmState Property ID**. The **AlarmState Property ID** is found in the AWS IoT SiteWise 
console on the **Models** page. Find the model which the alarm was created on. Under the **Alarm definitions**, you see your alarm. 
Use the **AlarmState Property ID** as the `propertyId` in the asset property query.

#### Example

```
query.timeSeriesData({
  assets: [{
    assetId: 'id',
    properties: [{ propertyId: 'alarmStatePropertyId' }]
  }]
})
```

This query requests an AWS IoT Events alarm stream, which is in 
one of [these states](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotevents/latest/apireference/API_iotevents-data_AlarmState.html). 
The alarms input property stream is associated with the alarm stream if queried. IoT Application Kit autogenerates thresholds 
that represent the alarm. This is how alarms are visualized in @iot-app-kit/components.
