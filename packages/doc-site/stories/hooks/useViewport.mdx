# useViewport

The `useViewport` react hook is a function used within react components to utilize and update a shared time frame within a group of
IoT App Kit widgets.

`useViewport` must be used within the context of a `<TimeSync />`. Learn more about [Time Sync](https://github.com/awslabs/iot-app-kit/blob/main/docs/TimeSync.md).

**Note**: This documentation assumes you are familiar with react and react-hooks. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

###  Example 
This example is of a component which displays the current viewport, and provides a button to set the viewport
to the last 5 minutes:
```
const BasicComponent = () => {
  const { viewport, setViewport } = useViewport();
  return (
    <div>
      {JSON.stringify(viewport)}
      <button onClick={() => setViewport({ duration: '5m' })}>Set viewport</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This component is then used in junction with the `<TimeSync />` component:

```
import { TimeSync } from '@iot-app-kit/react-components';


<TimeSync initialViewport={{ duration: '10m' }}>
  <BasicComponent />
</TimeSync>
```

The viewports can be synchronized. See example below where multiple newly created `<BasicComponent />`, 
all display the same viewport:

```
import { TimeSync } from '@iot-app-kit/react-components';


<TimeSync initialViewport={{ duration: '10m' }}>
  <BasicComponent />
  <BasicComponent />
  <BasicComponent />
</TimeSync>
```

### useViewport API Summary

This hook takes no inputs, and returns an object containing the following fields:

#### viewport (object):

The current viewport for the viewport group subscribed to. It's undefined 
if the hook is used outside of the context of a `<TimeSync />` component.
It's undefined if the associated viewport group has no associated viewport.

#### setViewport (viewport) => void

This is a function to which you pass a viewport to set the current viewport
group to. When called, the viewport group updates all consumers of the viewport group
with the new viewport.

### group (string):

An identifier representing the viewport shared amongst widget in the same TimeSync group. 
It is equal to the group passed into the parent TimeSync component (if provided), 
or a random UUID assigned by the TimeSync component.
