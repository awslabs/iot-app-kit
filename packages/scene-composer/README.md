## Debugging
Scene composer is embedded with a custom logging system based on [debugjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug). With this being a complex component with lots of potential things going on, this system allows you to filter logs based on more specific attributes, and ultimately reduces noise.

What you will notice is by default, there are very few messages in the browser console, this is because they are hidden by default from the end user, so you need to enable them in local storage. To do this, run this command in your browser console:

```javascript
localStorage.debug = '*'; // by default gives you all logging output
localStorage.debug = '*,-verbose:*'; // don't show verbose logging
localStorage.debug = 'ruleEvaluator*'; // only show messages related to the ruleEvaluator component
```
