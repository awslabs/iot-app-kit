# Scene Viewer

The SceneViewer component renders a specified [AWS IoT TwinMaker scene](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-twinmaker/latest/guide/scenes.html) for viewing experience.
It renders assets including `.svg` and `.hdr` files. You must configure a proper [file-loader](https://v4.webpack.js.org/loaders/file-loader/) for your application.
The sample code in the [examples/react-app](https://github.com/awslabs/iot-app-kit/tree/main/examples/react-app) directory has more details.

### Example

<Source dark="true" code={`
import { initialize } from '@iot-app-kit/source-iottwinmaker';
import { SceneViewer } from '@iot-app-kit/scene-composer';

const sceneLoader = initialize({ ... }).s3SceneLoader('scene-id');

<SceneViewer
  sceneLoader={sceneLoader}
/>
`} />

### Data bindings and rules

  * When the widgets tag, motion indicator, and overlay are configured with data bindings (entityId, componentName, propertyName), 
the SceneViewer component must access the property values of the data bindings so that the widgets can change based on value changes.
  * A `viewport` property is required, for the SceneViewer to know the expected time range for the property values. 
  * The `queries` or `dataStreams` properies are also passed in, and they return the property values to be used by data bindings. 
  If they are not provided, the SceneViewer component will automatically fetch property values for each data binding that exist in the rendered scene.

## Scene Viewer Properties

The Scene Viewer component's customizable properties are:

#### sceneLoader
##### (object, required) 

This is the class to load scene metadata and content. 
The `SceneLoader` object is defined in `@iot-app-kit/source-iottwinmaker`.

**Note**: When a new instance of this object is passed in, the SceneView triggers a new loading of the whole scene. 
Create this object only when needed.

#### sceneComposerId
##### (string, optional)

Specifies an unique id for an instance of the SceneViewer component. 
An uuid is auto generated, if one is not provided.

#### dataStreams
##### (object, optional): 

Specifies the data used by the viewer to change the visuals of the scene objects. The `meta` field of 
each stream is required to contain values for keys `entityId`, `componentName` and `propertyName`. 
The scene objects with the matching meta values uses the corresponding stream. The object `DataStream[]` is defined in `@iot-app-kit/core`.

**Note**: This property must be used together with `viewport`.

#### queries
##### (object, optional)

Specifies the data to be fetched. To learn more about queries, see [Core](https://github.com/awslabs/iot-app-kit/tree/main/docs/Core.md).
The object `TimeQuery<TimeSeriesData[], TimeSeriesDataRequest>[]` is defined in `@iot-app-kit/core`.

**Note**: This property must be used together with `viewport`.

#### viewport
##### (object, optional)

Specifies the window to query the data. The object `Viewport` is defined in `@iot-app-kit/core`.

**Note**: This property makes the data binding and rules work with property data. If `queires` or `dataStreams` are not provided, 
the property dataw is fetched by the SceneViewer component.

#### dataBindingTemplate
##### (object, optional)

Maps the data binding template names to the actual values used by the scene.
The object is of type `Record<string, string>`.

##### Example

Define a template named `sel_entity` in your scene, and bind to a Tag widget. Pass the following as `dataBindingTemplate`.
<Source dark="true" code={`
{
  'sel_entity': 'real-entity-1'
}
`} />
The Tag widget uses the data from `real-entity-1` to change its visual.

#### onSelectionChanged
##### (object, optional)

This callback is triggered if the selected node in the scene is changed. The information about the selection node is sent.
If deselected, empty information is sent. The object `SelectionChangedEventCallback` is defined in `@iot-app-kit/scene-composer`. 

#### onWidgetClick
##### (object, optional)

This callback is triggered when a widget in the scene is clicked. The information about the clicked widget is sent. The object 
`WidgetClickEventCallback` is defined in `@iot-app-kit/scene-composer`.

The Tag widget triggers this callback.

#### selectedDataBinding
##### (object, optional)

This sets the selected node on the Tag widget with matching `entityId` and `componentName`. Move the camera target on it.
If the `selectedDataBinding` value is undefined, action is not taken. If a matching Tag widget is not present, the currently selected node is deselected. The object is of type
 `Record<'entityId' | 'componentName', string>`.

#### activeCamera
##### (string, optional)

This sets the camera view by camera name. If this is not present, or not set the default initial camera is used. 
If `selectedDataBinding` is already selected, the `activeCamera` option is ignored in favor of focusing on the selected item.

#### config
##### (optional)

This specifies the configurations of the component.
